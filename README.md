# Development of an algorithm based on AI for the digital editing of images that adapts aesthetically any image with a different appearance.

A very common problem in digital image editing is that when what is known as a "photographic filter" is used, 
it does not fit perfectly in all images since contrast, tone may have different, lighting conditions, media areas, saturation and uniformity, etc. 
This project raises among other things that makes artificial intelligence lose the research question that can be developed: 
“With the help of an algorithm that allows adjusting these values in different photographs so that the filter adapts correctly?”. 
To carry out this research project, a basic filter is proposed, with which it is tested to adjust to different images through an algorithm 
based on artificial intelligence and thus know what are the editing parameters that make it fit or not. 

The objective is that the test images remain aesthetically similar to each other, that is, their appearance maintains a unit in terms of color range, 
lighting and contrast, commercial a task that is not at all simple and that is approached from a perspective for use of small businesses and ventures 
that need to maintain a well-defined brand image. Throughout the development of this document, many relevant aspects of digital image editing and 
a large number of tests carried out are presented; project that is born from the author's idea and which is worked from scratch, merely with resources 
and knowledge of the same.
